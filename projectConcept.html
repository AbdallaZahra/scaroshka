    </p>
    <h1>Role of 3D Animation in the Design Process</h1>
    <p>
      3D animation is at the heart of Scaroshka’s creative journey. It shapes
      the characters, environments, and narratives that inspire each design.
      This process allows us to explore dynamic visual concepts, such as
      movement and dimensionality, before translating them into wearable art. By
      combining animation with fashion, Scaroshka brings its stories to life,
      ensuring every product is a unique artistic statement.
    </p>
    <h1>Unique Character and Environment Themes</h1>
    <p>
      Every series of collections
      <span class="highlight">will focus on a specific country</span>,
      highlighting its civilization and culture, allowing us to share our
      wearable art across the globe. The narratives explore themes of cultural
      rebirth and transformation, giving Scaroshka’s designs a collectible
      appeal for customers who value deeper artistic and cultural connections.
