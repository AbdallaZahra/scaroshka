      <h2>Salary System</h2>
      <p>
        All team members will begin receiving their salaries after the end of
        the first collection from the profits generated from all sources.
        Scaroshka does not follow a fixed monthly salary system. Instead to
        ensure fair compensation for all team members. Salaries may vary from
        month to month based on the company's performance in every collection.
      </p>

      <h2>Rewards & Grading System</h2>
      <p>
        Outstanding work will be recognized with additional rewards. Scaroshka
        has a grading points system where each member earns points based on
        their contributions and performance. These points will be converted into
        monetary rewards, reflecting the value of the member’s exceptional
        efforts.
      </p>

      <h2>Deadlines & Accountability</h2>
      <p>
        Meeting deadlines is a critical part of Scaroshka’s workflow.
        <span style="text-transform: uppercase; color: rgb(143, 61, 61)"
          >Failure to meet deadlines without a valid and serious reason will
          result in a direct dismissal from the team.</span
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        We value and respect the talents of every team member. Scaroshka is
