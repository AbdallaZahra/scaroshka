    <h1>Our startup’s guidelines & agreements</h1>
    <h2>Salary System</h2>
    <p>
      All team members will begin receiving their salaries after the end of the
      first collection from the profits generated from all sources. Scaroshka
      does not follow a fixed monthly salary system. Instead to ensure fair
      compensation for all team members. Salaries may vary from month to month
      based on the company's performance in every collection.
    </p>

    <p></p>
    <h2>Rewards & Grading System</h2>
    <p>
      Outstanding work will be recognized with additional rewards. Scaroshka has
      a grading points system where each member earns points based on their
      contributions and performance. These points will be converted into
      monetary rewards, reflecting the value of the member’s exceptional
      efforts.
    </p>
    <h2>Deadlines & Accountability</h2>
    <p>
      Meeting deadlines is a critical part of Scaroshka’s workflow.
      <span style="color: rgb(174, 6, 6)"
        >Failure to meet deadlines without a valid and serious reason will
        result in a direct dismissal from the team.</span
      >
    </p>
    <h2>Fairness & Recognition</h2>
    <p>
      We value and respect the talents of every team member. Scaroshka is
      committed to ensuring that every member is rewarded fairly and that their
      efforts are recognized and compensated according to their contributions.
