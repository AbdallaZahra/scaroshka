    <p>
      In this proposal, you’ll come to see us as visual art makers, creativity
      seekers, and unconventional storytellers—all integral aspects of our
      mission. Together, these identities paint a full picture: we are creators
      on a mission to redefine visual artistry through boundary-pushing
      storytelling, fueled by a unwavering pursuit of creativity in every design
      and story. Our startup isn’t simply about producing unique clothing; it’s
      about creating wearable art pieces with collectible value. Each collection
      is part of a larger, evolving narrative world that expresses our identity
      through surreal, curiosity-provoking stories designed to captivate our
      audience. This world is brought to life through fictional characters who
      embody universal human emotions—fear, joy, anger, curiosity, and more
      These stories will be told through 3D animations and translated into
      captivating designs that appear as prints on our apparel.
